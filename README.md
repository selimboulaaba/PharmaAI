# Online-Health-Prediction-using-Django

## Introduction

This project proposes **Django-based Online Health Prediction platform**. This platform utilizes machine learning models to provide online predictions for various health conditions, including **mental disorders, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and obesity**. These predictions stem from trained models using datasets sourced from **Kaggle**. In addition to offering predictive health analysis, the platform allows users to have the option to download their online health reports generated from the predictions. Moreover, they can conveniently schedule appointments with healthcare professionals by providing their contact details and sending messages directly through the platform. For healthcare professionals, the platform offers the capability to register and manage appointments. Doctors can view and accept appointment requests sent by users.
